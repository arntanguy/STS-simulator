1.  I need the Differential Functions to be available for building Hierarchical Functions.
2. It is not possible to load new data in a project. Even starting a new project does not delete the experimental data for the DZs.
3. The shift of the positive integral values appears only at low X resolution (<100). Could stay like this.
4. When loading a project it loads the axis names but then when one changes or refreshes a plot it forgets the names and puts "X Axis" everywhere. It displays the loaded axis names but they are not loaded in the Plot settings of the configuration plot.
5. The program crashes when the file is saved in different directory than the program directory (Windows problem maybe)

Point 1 is the most important!
